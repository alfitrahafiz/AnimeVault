AnimeVault is a new project I'm working on as part of my learning journey with TypeScript and React. This website is designed to showcase anime-related content using the Jikan API.

Currently, the website only features a basic display of the top anime data, but in the future, I plan to integrate more endpoints from the Jikan API for additional functionality. The sidebar is not yet fully functional and is not connected to any API endpoints (like "Recommendation", "Seasonal", "Upcoming", etc.), but these features are part of the plan for future updates.

Key Features:
Top Anime List: Currently, only the top anime list is displayed, fetching data directly from the Jikan API.
Layout Options: The site will feature both grid and list layouts for displaying anime content.
Dark Mode: A dark mode toggle is implemented to offer an improved viewing experience for users.
What's Coming Next:
Sidebar functionality that will link to other API endpoints, including features like recommendations, seasonal anime, and upcoming shows.
More enhancements and additional data endpoints from the Jikan API to expand the anime database.
Additional UI/UX improvements.
Notes:
This is a simple and fun project that I started to practice TypeScript and React. It is still in its early stages, and there is much more to come. Please bear with me as I continue to add more features and polish the website.

I hope to stay motivated to keep adding new features and making this project better!
